After having prospected a couple of systems, the first ArchShip had not enough resources
for another trip.
The only solution was to land on a tide-locked planet. 

The planet being tide-locked, there is no dinamo and so no magnetic shield to deflect the solar wind.
As a solution, the ArchShip is landed on the planet (that's for good, there is no way to fly back such ship back to orbit).
In that way, the ArcShip dynamo creates a shield on the planet. 
The landing spot is chosen to be on the part of the planet facing the sun. 
This part has a quiet spot in the middle of the eye of the storm and faces the sun, thus supplying energy.

This will become ArcCity, the center of the new civilization. It's shielded both from the solar wind and from the planetary storms.

The planet has some resources, mostly minerals, but also the potential to re-grow some organic resources.
The conditions on the planet are hard (see below)

From ArcCity, some train lines have been established to join other spots, attempt to colonize parts of the planet.
Just outside ArcCity, the wind is terrifying, it's the confluence of the wind coming back from the dark side of the planet.
However, the surrounding is also exposed to the combined natural solarwind and the one deflected from ArcCity.
The only "safe" way to travel is in heavy shielded trains.

The outposts built outside relied on these trains for re-supply and news.
In one remote outpost, closer to the dark side, one day the train did not come back, and would never again...
The priority for this outpost shifted completely to become self sustained, with very limited resources and people to spare
Fortunately, despite the hard environment, energy was plentiful, given by the wind.

After a few generations, ArcCity became a distant knowledge from the past. A few more later, it was a myth...


=====================================================

A planet has been tide locked for some time...
The bright side is directly exposed to the sun where it never sets anymore.
The dark side, opposite, is forever kept from seeing the sun.
 
Violent winds storm from the burning side to the cold one.
Gigantic structures (mountains?) are shaped to keep a somewhat laminar, yet violent, flow.
These result in effectively large corridors. Some drive the wind in one way. Some go the other way.
Wind turbines, in these corridors, face the wind and scavenge some energy.

The dark side is surrounded by a perpetual cyclone.
In the eye of the cyclone, a launch pad, shielded from the storm and the solarwind (by the earth itself)
is the only gate to the space.

In the space, a space-line is attached to the moon and circles around the planet.
A space-dock has been built at its null gravity point---the place where the ArcheShip is being built

The wind being so strong, some flying machine can be used to flow with the wind, but not to go against it.

A large fraction of the light side is struck by the solar wind, except for the main city, shielded with the Arcship shield.

=====================================================

The train probably did not come due to a pretty bad CME. 
What's the status in ArcCity at that time?


Could go full conspiration theory mode:
The train did not come because there was not enough space on the ArcShip II, the new ship being built on the spaceline. 
Rather than calling everyone back from the outposts, some communication was stopped.


=====================================================
Alternate playing between two story lines happening at two different times? (but the player does not know that at the beginning)
One in the isolated outpost at the time when ArcShip II already left (but there is still a way to communicate with it, and most of the infrastructure which enabled it are still there)

One in the past, at the time when communication with most outposts were lost and while trying to build ArcShip II.



======================================================
History

 - The Archship lands
 - It estrablishes a site on the light side, using itself as a shield against the solar wind
 - Outposts are established to start gathering resources
 - The only site identified to build a space launch site is in the eye of the cyclone, on the dark side, shielded from the solar wind
 - Some outposts face political difficulties: a fraction of the population wants to live on the planet despite its current state, while another fraction leans towards aggressive
 exploitation of all resources with the intent to leave at all costs within a few decades
