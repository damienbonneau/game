# Plot challenge
 Every agent has an initiative indicated on their card
 
 The first player reveals one agent entering the plot
 
 Players then take turns revealing their agents using the following rules:
 
The next player now has the options: 
 - To bring some agents in the plot: 
   - as many agents having a initiative between the last initiative they played (if they haven't played yet, the last initiative is considered to be 0) and the initiative of the last agent revealed by the previous player.
   - They may in addition play one of their agent having a higher initiative.
 
 - To pass 

When both players pass, the plot is resolved by adding up all the plot points
and resolving the agents abilities.
