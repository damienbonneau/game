You are at the head of an influent family in middle-age settings. 



# Turn

4 actions per turn
Actions are represented by tokens sharing a common face and where the other face represents the action. 
Each town has an action stack. 
Taking turns, each player places a single action on the top of any town stack (like in the Starcraft Boardgame). 
Once players cannot place any action anymore, then they take turn unstacking an action from the top of a pile.

On top of that each action may consume some additional resources such as influence and action points.

Each turn starts with a pool of action points to share among all the actions being taken within the turn.
The baseline is 4 Action points per turn, but this may be altered with some building special abilities.

At the end of each turn, AFTER the city adjusts its economy balance (gains and losses), gain some gold (taken from the town's treasuries) based on the influence in the town.
(probaly need to use a sub-linear scale here)

Types of actions:
1 - Deploy an agent
2 - move an agent
3 - activate an agent
4 - activate a city ability 
5 - relocalte yourself

Each action has an AP cost and sometimes an influence cost.

1 - Deploying an agent
An agent may be deployed only in a city where you have at least two influence.
The deployment cost is 1 AP per lvl. The AP cost may be reduced (but not below 1AP) by paying 3 Influence points per AP.

2 - Move an agent
You may move an agent from a city to an adjacent one for 1 AP.
You may not activate an agent which has moved during the turn. 
You may not move an agent which has been deployed during the turn.
However, you may activate an agent and then move it. 

3 - activating an agent

Agents with intrigue capabilities are normally placed face down, only showing their level, but not their abilities. 
By activating an agent, you flip the agent face up. Apply any triggered effect and then benefit from his influence bonus.

4 - activating a city ability
Some cities have abilities which may be activated at some cost once some conditions are fulfilled. The activation cost is specified on the city cards.

5 - relocate yourself
At the cost of 3AP, move to a neighbouring city, friendly (4+ influence) to your family

End of turn: Gather influence based on the conditions in each city.

# Activating agents - triggered events

## Plot - Intrigue
As soon as an agent with a non-zero intrigue is revealed, an intrigue fight happens.
After all the actions of the turn have been performed, sum the total number of intrigue points, this provides the 'Intrigue strength' for the attacking player. 
Your opponent gets a chance to reveal immediately some of his followers at a cost of one action per follower (deducted from his next turn). 
She also adds the total number of already revealed agent with at least one intrigue point (only the number of agents not the intrigue points.
Having been revealed, they are less efficient) This provides the 'Intrigue strength' for the defending player.
In case of equality, nothing happens, otherwise whoever lost must remove a total number of agent lvl equal to the difference.

Example
Player1 reveals 2 agents each with 2 Intrigue for a total of four. 
After P1 finishes her remaining actions, Player2 chooses to reveal 1 Agent with intrigue 1. She also have another pre-revealed lvl2 agent with intrigue 2. This adds +1 for the agent. 4 - 2 = 2  =>
P2 has to remove a total of 2 lvl of agents. She chooses to retreat her lvl 2 agent.

## Assassination
If a player P1 activates an assassin, she may choose a valid target (depending on the assassin lvl). The target is removed from the city as well as the assassin (who vanishes).
If the other player P2 has a spy and if the spy lvl is sufficient, she may immediately activate the spy at no cost to target the assassin. In that case, P1's agents must leave the city immediately to a neighbouring friendly city. The city special abilities (building or personalities) may not be activated by this player until the end of the game. The assassination still take place.
